Jodhpur is divided into two main areas- the old city and the new city.The old city is separated from the main city by a 10 km long wall that surrounds its boundary. There are eight gates to enter and exit the old city which is majorly a tourist attraction with some iconic hotspots within its parameters while the new city is a modern metropolis that surrounds the old city and houses all major developments of Jodhpur.</p>
